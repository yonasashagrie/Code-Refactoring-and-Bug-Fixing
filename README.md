# Flask Session Notes App

This Flask application is designed to allow users to add and view notes using session management. Users can add notes through a simple web interface, and the notes are stored in the session, allowing them to persist across requests.

## Purpose

This project serves as a practice exercise for code refactoring and bug fixing as part of an internship at Innomatics Research Lab. It provides an opportunity to work with Flask, session management, and web development concepts while improving coding skills and understanding of best practices.

## Features

- **Add Notes:** Users can add notes through a web form.
- **View Notes:** Users can view all the notes they have added.
- **Session Management:** Notes are stored in the user's session, allowing them to persist across requests.
